CMPG 323 Project 1 Agile and Scrum
Repositories to be created
CMPG 323 Overview - <32937423>
   Branching Strategy All Projects
    Gitflow: This enables parallel development where developers can work separately from the master branch on features where a feature branch is created from     the master branch. Afterwards, when changes are complete, the developer merges these changes back to the master branch for release.
    
   .gitignore file (All repositories):
      this is a file that is plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore when other files of the project folder is           being pushed to github and this file will contain all the files to ignore.
   Seperate submissions for all the projects named below
   
CMPG 323 Project 2 - <32937423>:
  Overview
  Smart devices such as voice controllers, security lights, smart locks and Wi-Fi-enabled devices 
  can communicate and exchange data over the Internet. Devices form distributed ecosystems that 
  can perform environmental monitoring of homes and buildings. The exposure of IoT device 
  capabilities and data through the Web is fundamental. An IoT Device Management System helps 
  you register, organise, monitor, and remotely manage IoT devices at scale as IoT deployments 
  range in size, complexity, objectives and requirements. 
  An IoT Device Management System keeps track of the whereabouts of all IoT devices deployed 
  by the organisation. Depending on the type of organisation, different categories of devices are 
  used. Each IoT device is initially categorised and registered. Then, IoT devices are deployed 
  throughout the organisation's buildings in predefined zones. Administrators can view all IoT 
  devices, update their properties, add new devices and move them to other zones. 
  Representational State Transfer (REST) is a model and architectural style for web services over 
  HTTP. When this model is used for API design, IoT devices can be managed using the Cloud. 
  Therefore, the IoT Device Management System should be implemented as a set of RESTful APIs. 
  RESTful APIs and services are used as a good practice in the industry to transport data between 
  systems, environments, interfaces and applications. One of the most common use cases is 
  connecting a RESTful API to a data source to manage interaction with the data source. This 
  approach lends many advantages to a solution mostly addressing longevity. RESTful APIs 
  commonly consist of different methods that allow for retrieval of data and manipulation of data 
  (creation, amendment and deletion). 
  As part of this project, you will create a CRUD RESTful API that will connect to a database storing 
  IoT device data. The API should contain at least one get, post, patch and delete method per 
  resource – aligning to the project's requirements. The RESTful API architecture has several 
  endpoints called over HTTP, invoking application code to update a database.

CMPG 323 Project 3 - <32937423>:
  Overview
  In this day and age, there are millions of applications that have been created and are widely used. 
  A developer’s ability to read and understand code is even more important than their ability to write 
  code. As such, you will be given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need 
  to be enhanced and improved. 
  As part of this project, you will be expected to understand architectural patterns as well as pay 
  specific attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns – aligning to the
  requirements of the project.
  
  
CMPG 323 Project 4 - <32937423>:
  Overview
  Testing is a crucial part of any solution and can be done from many different perspectives; the 
  internal development team testing, business user acceptance testing (UAT), etc. There are also 
  many different types of testing that can be conducted on a solution and user acceptance testing 
  is usually done very manually. UAT is often included in most development lifecycles as a crucial 
  step that acts as the ‘go/no-go’ decision maker. UAT is focused on ensuring that the input entered 
  into the solution generates the expected output. If the solution does not generate the desired 
  output, the solution needs to be amended and retested as the solution would generally not be 
  published to production unless it passes all tests in UAT. 
  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the 
  same way that a person would execute a process. This usually refers to, what we would call, 
  ‘front-end’ or UI (User Interface) automation. RPA is often used to automate time-consuming and 
  highly repetitive tasks to allow people the availed capacity to work on more intuitive tasks. 
  Let’s take the web application that you worked on in Project 3 – before the solution can be 
  deployed into production, it would need to go through UAT where a team of ‘testers’ would have 
  a test dataset containing input data and desired output data. The testers would then insert each 
  record of input data into each field of the web application and test that the desired output is 
  generated. In this case, the desired output would be a new record being displayed on the web 
  application once the item has been added. This would resort in a highly repetitive process which 
  can and should (in this case) be automated using RPA.
  
CMPG 323 Project 5 - <32937423>:
  Overview
  The Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices within the network, 
  placed all over the office building, to collect and share the data that these devices gather. The 
  data can be shared in different ways. One of which is through visualisations built into a report or 
  dashboard. These reports or dashboards can be shared with different stakeholders, potentially 
  with different levels of access applied. The COI have been advised that a good way to monitor 
  the usage of their IoT devices would be through a report. 
  The report will be built in Power BI, as the organisation already has all applicable licensing 
  agreements in place with Microsoft, and the report is expected to allow all stakeholders to see the 
  same information pertaining to the status of IoT device registrations on various platforms. As a 
  member of the COI development team, you are expected to acquire and practise the necessary 
  skills to create such a report.
